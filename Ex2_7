**Algorithm:**
Input:
Read a string from the user (e.g., "abcdab").
Search Process:
Initialize a boolean flag (flag) to track whether a non-repeating character is found.
Iterate through each character in the input string:
Check if the index of the current character is the same as its last index (using indexOf() and lastIndexOf()).
If so, itâ€™s a non-repeating character.
Print the first non-repeating character found and set the flag to false.
Break out of the loop.
Output:
If no non-repeating character is found, print a message indicating that there is none.

**Program:**
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Ex2_7 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Input a String: ");
        String word = scanner.next();
        boolean flag = true;

        for (char i : word.toCharArray()) {
            if (word.indexOf(i) == word.lastIndexOf(i)) {
                System.out.println("The first non-repeating character is: " + i);
                flag = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (flag) {
            System.out.println("There is no non-repeating character in the input string.");
        }
    }
}
